# Code Interpreter

Sandboxed code execution service for LibreChat, providing secure execution of user-submitted code with file storage and tool calling capabilities.

## Overview

Code Interpreter (internally `codeapi`, the prefix used by its env vars, images, and helm chart) is a multi-component service that enables LibreChat to safely execute user code in isolated sandboxes. It consists of five independently scalable components that communicate via Redis queues and S3-compatible storage.

## Components

- **API** - HTTP gateway that accepts code execution requests and returns results
- **Worker Sandbox** - Executes code in NsJail (or libkrun microVM) sandboxes with resource limits
- **File Server** - Manages file uploads/downloads via S3 (IRSA authentication)
- **Tool Call Server** - Handles programmatic tool calls from within sandbox sessions
- **Package Delivery** - Bakes Python, Node, and Bun into the default microVM
  block-root image; a package-init PVC mode remains available for direct NsJail
  development
- **Remote Code Bridge** - Lets an operator-owned VM connect outbound and serve
  as a fenced, stateful sandbox through the `@librechat/code` worker

## ScienceChat scientific runtime

This fork adds a reproducible scientific Python layer for the ScienceChat SANS
workbench:

- the runtime Python version is configurable with `CODEAPI_PYTHON_VERSION`;
- production Helm defaults to Python 3.12.12;
- `python-packages-extra.txt` pins SANS, Scipp/NeXus, reflectometry,
  diffraction/imaging, spectroscopy, crystallography, units, and inference
  packages selected for the ESS instrument suite;
- built-in sasmodels CPU kernels are precompiled in single and double precision
  during package/image construction;
- the final sandbox remains compiler-free and keeps writable workspaces
  no-exec.

Only built-in sasmodels kernels are supported. User-supplied models that need a
new native kernel cannot be compiled at runtime. Static plots should prefer
matplotlib; Plotly HTML works without a browser, while Kaleido static export
requires a separately reviewed browser dependency.

The package groups reflect the techniques listed at
<https://ess.eu/instruments>: diffraction and imaging, large-scale structures
(SANS, reflectometry, and macromolecular diffraction), and spectroscopy. See
[ScienceChat neutron-scattering Python environment](docs/sciencechat-python-environment.md)
for the package inventory, scope, and exclusions.
Mantid, McStas, refl1d, and molecular-dynamics runtimes are intentionally not in
the default image because they require a separate application/runtime or
conflict with the pinned SANS stack.

The `ScienceChat images` workflow publishes the API, worker, baked microVM
sandbox, direct-NsJail sandbox, package-init, file-server, tool-call-server,
and egress-gateway images to GHCR for `sciencechat-v*` tags. Both sandbox
images are built for `linux/amd64` with Python 3.12.12. The NsJail image is for
restricted evaluation only and requires the matching package-init image and
PVC package delivery. Deploy all images from the same tag or immutable digest.

## Architecture

1. LibreChat sends a code execution request to the **API**
2. API enqueues the job in Redis
3. **Worker Sandbox** picks up the job and executes code inside an isolated sandbox
4. Files are persisted/retrieved via the **File Server** (backed by S3)
5. Tool calls from within sandboxes are routed through the **Tool Call Server**

## Execution profiles

Code API can run two isolated deployments at the same time:

- `default`: the AWS-free HTTP/libkrun path, with stateless executions.
- `stateful`: the AWS Lambda MicroVM path, with runtime-session affinity.

Set `CODEAPI_EXECUTION_PROFILE` consistently on an API deployment and its
workers. The default profile keeps the existing `python-queue` and
`other-queue`; the stateful profile uses `stateful-python-queue` and
`stateful-other-queue`. This allows both deployments to share Redis without
cross-consuming jobs. The `remote-bridge` backend additionally uses
`remote-bridge-python-queue` and `remote-bridge-other-queue`, fencing attached
worker jobs from Lambda consumers during rolling deployments.

An existing Lambda MicroVM deployment upgraded from a pre-profile release may
leave `CODEAPI_EXECUTION_PROFILE` unset for its first binary rollout. An
affinity/strict deployment still identifies itself as `stateful`; a stateless
Lambda deployment identifies itself as `default`. Both temporarily keep the
legacy queue names so separately deployed APIs and workers remain compatible
with old binaries.
Move that deployment to the isolated stateful queues with a blue/green cutover:
start replacement API and worker pools with the profile explicitly set to
`stateful`, verify them together, switch the stateful endpoint, and drain the
legacy pool. For rollback, switch the endpoint back before stopping the
replacement pool. Do not run the inferred stateful compatibility mode beside a
default deployment on the same Redis because both use the legacy queues.

Trusted callers should send `X-CodeAPI-Expected-Profile: default|stateful` on
every Code API request. A request that reaches the wrong deployment fails
before enqueue with HTTP 409 and `error=execution_profile_mismatch`; every
response advertises the actual deployment in `X-CodeAPI-Execution-Profile`.
Omitting the expected-profile header remains supported for older clients, but
provides no wrong-endpoint protection. There is deliberately no silent
fallback between profiles and no automatic workspace or file migration.

## Sandbox Isolation

Two modes are supported:

- **NsJail mode** (`kvmEnabled: false`): Direct NsJail sandboxing with Linux namespaces and cgroups. Its runner requires `SYS_ADMIN` and unconfined Seccomp/AppArmor to establish its private mount namespace; it shares the node kernel and is evaluation-only.
- **MicroVM mode** (`kvmEnabled: true`): libkrun microVM with its own kernel, NsJail runs inside the guest

## Remote stateful environments

The `remote-bridge` backend keeps the Code API as the policy and queue boundary
while moving execution to a sandbox on an operator-selected VM. The worker only
makes outbound authenticated requests, so the VM does not need a public ingress
port. Assignments carry a deadline, a single-active-worker lock, a monotonically
increasing generation, and a one-time lease token to fence stale workers.

See [Remote Code Bridge](docs/remote-bridge/README.md) for deployment and threat
model details. The worker protocol and CLI live in the provider-neutral
[`@librechat/code`](packages/code/README.md) package.

## Security disclaimer

This service exists to run arbitrary, untrusted code — treat every
deployment decision accordingly.

In its full hardened configuration — MicroVM mode (`kvmEnabled: true`, so
sandboxed code runs under a separate guest kernel) with NsJail inside the
guest, seccomp filtering, the egress gateway in front of all
sandbox-originated traffic, network policies applied, signed execution
manifests, and `hardenedSandboxMode` left on — it is reasonably secure and
designed with defense in depth. NsJail-only mode shares the host kernel and
provides meaningfully weaker isolation: it is appropriate for local
development, not for executing untrusted code from people you don't trust.

No software is 100% secure. Sandbox escapes, kernel vulnerabilities, and
misconfiguration are all real risks for any code-execution system. Keep the
hardening defaults on, run the stack on isolated infrastructure with least
privilege, keep hosts patched, and deploy responsibly. If you believe you
have found a vulnerability, please report it privately rather than opening a
public issue (see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md)).

## Releases

Deployments should pin a [tagged release](https://github.com/LibreChat-AI/code-interpreter/releases)
rather than track `main`, which moves whenever an internal snapshot is merged:

```bash
git clone --branch v2.0.0 --depth 1 https://github.com/LibreChat-AI/code-interpreter.git
```

Every release attaches `codeapi-<chart version>.tgz`, the packaged Helm chart
with its Redis and MinIO subcharts vendored:

```bash
helm install codeapi ./codeapi-0.3.0.tgz -f my-values.yaml
```

Versions are `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, with `-rcN` release candidates published as
pre-releases. See [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md) for how releases are
cut.

## Local Development

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

The default KVM Compose path builds `sandbox-runner-baked`: the guest root and
`/pkgs` tree live in a read-only ext4 block image instead of a long-lived
virtio-fs mount. The first image build takes longer because it compiles the
language runtimes, but package-heavy workloads do not accumulate host file
descriptors in the launcher.

Setting `KVM_ENABLED=false` still selects the directory-root target and the
host package mount automatically for direct NsJail development.

Local Docker Compose files set `CODEAPI_INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN` to a shared
development value by default. Production deployments must override it with a
strong secret; when it is unset, file object routes and Tool Call Server
session-management routes stay unauthenticated for backwards compatibility.
